# RL_tutorial
## The STAT616 final project

The lecture is instructed by Professor [Wei Qian](https://sites.google.com/a/udel.edu/weiqian/). This lecture mainly focus on the SOTA RL techniques. Some materials in the report is directly taken from his lecture.

The main file is the pdf report named `tutorial.pdf`.

## To replicate the result in the CartPole Section of the report
1. download the repository
2. Run `cart_experiment.ipynb` (while the code is majorly stored in main.py)


## To replicate the result in the Bandit Algorithm Section of the report
All the following files are located in "Bandit Algorithm Exploration" Folder
1. For replicate ETC: `ETC.ipynb`
2. For epsilon-greedy: `epsilon.ipynb`
3. For replicate UCB and LinUCB: `UCB.ipynb`
4. For replicate thompson sampling: `thompson.ipynb`
