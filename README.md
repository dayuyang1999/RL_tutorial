## The STAT616 final project

The lecture is instructed by Professor [Wei Qian](https://sites.google.com/a/udel.edu/weiqian/). This lecture mainly focus on getting first touch with reinforcement learning techniques. Some materials in the report is directly taken from his lecture notes. So **without permission of Professor Qian Wei, copy content from this directory is forbidden**.

The main file is the pdf report named `tutorial.pdf`.

## To replicate the result in the CartPole Section of the report
1. download the repository
2. Run `cart_experiment.ipynb` (while the code is majorly stored in main.py)
